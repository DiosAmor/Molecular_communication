# Molecular communication simulator
Simulates diffusion channel in 3D env with a planar source(s) and an absorbing receiving plane

Two options for velocity profile
1. Poiseuille flow
2. Uniform flow

## Please run the simulator by "board_Test_DEBUG.m"

Please check the system model of the simulator at /doc/systemModel.ppt

The example of data is at /data
